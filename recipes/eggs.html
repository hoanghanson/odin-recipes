    <p>Recipe for perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs. By adding a little vinegar and salt, the eggshell peels off so easily without tearing or sticking.</p>
        
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup distilled water</li>
            <li>6 cups water</li>
            <li>8 large eggs</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Combine salt, vinegar, and water in a large pot, and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
            <li>Add eggs one at a time, being careful not to crack them. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil, and cook for 14 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once eggs have cooked, remove them from the hot water, and place into a container of ice water or cold, running water. Cool completely, about 15 minutes. Store in the refrigerator up to 1 week.</li>
        </ol>
