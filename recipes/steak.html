<h1>Marinated Flank Steak</h1>
<img src="steak.jpg" alt="Marinated Flank Steak">

<p>A great flank steak marinade like this one is important if you want a tender, juicy, flavorful steak. Make sure you marinate your flank steak for at least 2 hours for best results or longer if you have time. This wonderful quick and easy recipe also works great when the steak is sliced and used for fajitas.</p>

<p>Flank and skirt steaks are similar in a lot of ways, but they do have notable differences. Skirt steak comes from the diaphragm of the cow, while flank steak comes from the lower abdomen. Also, skirt steak is fattier and has more marbling than flank steak. Flank steak is thicker and wider.</p>
